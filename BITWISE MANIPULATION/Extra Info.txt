Toggling k-th bit of a number
1) Left shift given number 1 by k-1 to create 
   a number that has only set bit as k-th bit.
    temp = 1 << (k-1)
2) Return bitwise XOR of temp and n.  Since temp
   has only k-th bit set, doing XOR would toggle 
   only this bit.
   
n = 75 and k = 4
 temp = 1 << (k-1) = 1 << 3 = 8 
 Binary Representation of temp = 0..00001000 
 Binary Representation of n = 0..01001011 
 Bitwise XOR of two numbers = 0..01000011
